          eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for
          anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray
          Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

          pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his
